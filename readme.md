Rules of the game
---
The NBA playoff bracket game I am playing is as follows. 
Each participant is to pick 4 teams. Each team you pick will get your points for each game won according to their seed
- 1st and 2nd seed teams 1 points
- 3rd and 4th seed teams 2 points
- 5th and 6th seed teams 3 points
- 7th and 8th seed teams 4 points

Picks of teams will be in order. The tie breaker is based on who's first choice team gained more points for them.

For example, if you choose a 3rd seed team and they win 4 of the games in the first round but only 2 of the games in the second round, they would win you (6 games) * (2 points per game) = 12 points

Basic Usage

You must have python installed and then you can just run

```python3 nba.py```

You can edit ```config.py``` to set the odds for each possible matchup yourself. All odds default to 50/50.

Running the script will make 10,000 copies of the current bracket, simulate every single matchup according to the odds selected, and keep a running total of who wins each simulated bracket.
In the earlier rounds it is not feasible to calculate all 8^15 ~ 10 trillion brackets, but maybe later I will do a more exhaustive approach.

Maximum scores are also computed
